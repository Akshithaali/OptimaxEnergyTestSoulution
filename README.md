# OptimaxEnergyTestSoulution
A Java project that simulates an auction between two bidders using different strategies. Including Junit testcases for both.


This project implements a **strategic bidder** for a simulated auction game using Java. The bidder dynamically adapts its bidding strategy based on the opponent's behavior and remaining resources. The project also includes a basic opponent bidder and JUnit test cases for validation.
